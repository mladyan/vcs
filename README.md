## Version Control System - Petnica Project
**TEAM 7 - MLADJAN SIMIC and MILICA MIHAILOVIC**

Simple GUI implementation of Version Control System. This project was done as a part of our assignment in Petnica Science Center.
You can organize your projects on your local machine. This VCS relies on 3 simple functionalities.
* Push
  * Push makes a duplicate of all your files in selected directory and moves them to previousver folder located one directory up from vercontrol directory.
* Select version
  * Select version brings them back from previousver to your selected directory.
* Log
  * Log shows changes you have made.

There is also projekat_terminal.py file, which includes all GUI functionalities.

## Goals
* Short term: Make project independent of IDE, i.e. add CPython interpreter so that the project can be run independently
* Long term: Server integrations
